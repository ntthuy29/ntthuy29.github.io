    <h1 style="font-family:Simplified Arabic Bold">Txti has retired.</h1>
    <p>Txti was created in 2014 with a simple and benevolent mission: to play a part in a more<br> globally accessible
        internet. Our slogan was "fast web pages for everybody," and it<br> worked! Txti served millions of people, with
        well over half a million fast web pages created.<br> Since then, the whole world has changed. Now, there is less
        need for web pages that<br> work on flip phones, and more need for trustworthiness and safety on the internet.
        As txti<br> is not able to keep up with this need, it's time for it to step aside to ensure we're not<br>
        causing harm.</p>
    <p>Thank you to everyone who used and loved txti. It was a fun and useful project that I<br> simply wasn't able to
        maintain. There are many lessons learned here, but I'm grateful to<br> have been a part of a <a
            href="https://www.omegle.com/">special</a> <a href="BUOI 1/index.html">era</a> of the internet's evolution.</p>
    <p>Peace and love,</p>
    <p>B</p>
